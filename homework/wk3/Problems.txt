5.1) Use PrimerBank (“google PrimerBank”) to look up PCR primers for your favorite gene
Use Search By: “NCBI Gene Symbol”, Species: “Human” to find PCR primers for your gene. 
Write a program to compute the reverse complement sequence of both the forward and reverse primer (in one program).

5.2) Write a program to test whether a PCR primer is a reverse complement palindrome.
Such a primer might fold and self-hybridize!
Test your program on at least the following primers:
TTGAGTAGACGCGTCTACTCAA
TTGAGTAGACGTCGTCTACTCAA
ATATATATATATATAT
ATCTATATATATGTAT

6.1) Extend your solution for Exercise 1 from Lecture 5 to get its two PCR primers from the command-line.

6.2) Write a command-line program for manipulating a DNA sequence:
DNA sequence in a file, with the filename provided on the command-line
Manipulation command also provided on the command-line:
Command is one of: Complement, Reverse, or ReverseComplement
Print the DNA sequence, and the appropriate manipulation of the DNA sequence to the terminal.
