METHODS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic functions were defined in two scripts: 'codon_table' and 'MyDNAStuff' per the instructions. These functions were then imported to 16.1.py and used to do a basic translation exercise like we have done previously.

DISCUSSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The core task of this script is something we have done previously in this course, however, we are now using the "import" statement in python to load scripts we have written in the same directory. Due to the way the import searches for modules, it is important that one executes the import statement in the same directory as the files one wishes to import. When many scripts/dependencies are required, it may sometimes be useful to organize them into a properly defined python module and install them in the environment. There are multiple methods of loading other scripts into a program, however, import is very simple and straightforward in most cases.
