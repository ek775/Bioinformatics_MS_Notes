METHODS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data was loaded into a pandas dataframe for analysis and exploration. Basic descriptive statistics were calculated to help gain a better understanding of the data's distribution, then the results needed to answer the exercise questions were calculated and printed to the terminal.

DISCUSSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Its worth pointing out here that I actually wrote 99% of this exercise in a jupyter notebook so that I could actually see some of the data I was working with prior to carrying out blind calculations. Doing this kind of analysis with plain scripting tools is frequently more time consuming and prone to errors because you don't have the feedback of understanding the dataset you're working with prior to writing your scripts. The only workaround to this is to write small scripts in a stepwise fashion and display the results - however, at that point you might as well use a notebook which is built for this kind of workflow and would document these steps in a much cleaner fashion.
