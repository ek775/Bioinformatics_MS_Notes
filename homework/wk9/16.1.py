Exercise 16.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rework the lecture, and your solutions (or mine) from the Homeworks #1 through #4, to make a MyDNAStuff module.
Put as many useful nucleotide functions as possible into the module...

Rework the lecture, and your solutions (or mine) from Homework #5 to make the codon_table module with functions specified in this lecture.

Demonstrate the use of these modules to translate an amino-acid sequence in all six-frames with just a few lines of code.
The final result should look similar to Slide 10.
Your program should handle DNA sequence with Nâ€™s in it.
