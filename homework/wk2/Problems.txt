#3.1
Download or copy-and-paste the DNA sequence of the Anthrax SASP gene from the anthrax_sasp.nuc file in the course data-directory. Treat the provided sequence as the sequence to be translated (no 5' UTR).Write a Python program to print answers to the following questions:
Does the SASP gene start with a Met codon?
Does the SASP gene have a frame 1 Met codon? 
How many nucleotides in the SASP gene?
How many amino-acids in the SASP protein?
What is the GC content (% G or C nucleotides) of the SASP gene?
Test your program with other gene sequences.


#4.1
Write a Python program to compute the reverse complement of a codon
Use my solution to Homework #1 Exercise #1 as a starting point
Add the “complement” function of this lecture(slide 9) as provided.
Modularize! Place the reverse complement code in a new function. 
Call the new function with a variety of codons
Change the complement function to handle upper and lower-case nucleotide symbols.
Test your code with upper and lower-case codons.

#4.2
Write a Python program to determine whether or not a DNA sequence consists of a (integer) number of (perfect) "tandem" repeats.
Test it on sequences:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
CACACACACACACAC
ATTCGATTCGATTCG
GTAGTAGTAGTAGTA
TCAGTCACTCACTCAG
Hint: Is the sequence the same as many (how many?) repetitions of its first character? 
Hint: Is the sequence the same as many (how many?) repetitions of its first two characters?
